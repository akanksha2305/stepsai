Vicente-Saez and\nMartinez-Fuente\u2019s definition speaks more of access and sharing than of open access as such, since sharing may\nbe subject to legal or ethical restrictions. This definition is therefore more in line with the FAIR principles\nthan that of Foster Open Science. The principles of transparency are also less developed in the Foster Open\nScience definition. It only mentions conditions favoring reuse, without being explicit about these conditions,\nand makes no reference to quality assurance and auditing, which are facilitated by transparency principles.\nReflective Question 2:\nAnswers may vary according to someone\u2019s point of view and expertise, and could include examples outside\nthose listed in this chapter. However, Table 2 indicates that the pragmatic school of thought frequently410 | SOLUTIONS\nshapes open science. Examples include open research protocols, academic social networks and other\ncollaborative platforms, such as electronic lab notebooks, and finally open peer review.\nReflective Question 3:\nFalse. Commercial publishers have consolidated their position by making article processing charges the\npredominant open access business model, and we cannot rule out that acquiring infrastructure linked to\nresearch data is not in their line of sight. Elsevier already offers its data repository, Mendeley Data. The\nScholarly Kitchen blog regularly discusses acquisitions and mergers in the field of healthcare publishing. Take\na look at this example: \u201cElsevier to Acquire Interfolio.\u201d\nReflective Question 4:\nFor qualitative research, the production of research data is often dependent on the context in which it was\nproduced. Thus it is problematic to think of reproducibility if research contexts are unique. Reproducibility\nin qualitative research must therefore be considered in light of various epistemological postures, which\nthemselves call for their own methodologies and analytical guidelines.\nReflective Question 5:\nThe field of critical data studies.\n"
